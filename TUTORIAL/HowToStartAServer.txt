How to do everything

1: Fork it
2: Clear all previous logs (Fully delete all logs in bungee/logs, server/logs, server/world, server/nether, server/world_the_end, and adjust anything in the plugins)
3: look up serverproperties (MOTD, member count, server icon, etc.)
4: Change anything you want


To add plugins, go to https://github.com/royalxvirus/eagleplugins
There are many others that you can find on spigiot, bukkit, etc

Drag and drop your desired plugins into the folder named plugins. AuthME is buggy asf
